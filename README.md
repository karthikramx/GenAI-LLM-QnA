- Langchain: A framework that gives developers to construct LLM-powered applications easily
- Pinecone: A vector database that helps power AI application, basically stores vector embeddings, to create custom LLM apps
- OpenAI: Do you really need an introduction?

I followed this project from : https://zerotomastery.io/courses/learn-langchain-pinecone/
Merely following the project wont help, as langchain is updating frequently,
You should be able to use the requirements specific versions to run this application, and the api keys too (obviously)
